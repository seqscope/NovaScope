This tutorial provides instructions for running [NovaScope](../index.md) using [three example datasets](https://github.com/seqscope/NovaScope/tree/main/testrun).

Before downloading the example datasets, you must [install](../installation/requirement.md) NovaScope in your computing environment and set up your [environment config file](../installation/env_setup.md).

In this tutorial, we will guide you on how to (a) access the example datasets, (b) set up your input configuration file, and (c) execute the [NovaScope](../index.md) pipeline based on the prepared input files.
