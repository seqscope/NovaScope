[NovaScope](../index.md) is a sophisticated pipeline containing multiple steps for processing spatial transcriptomics data. 
Installing individual software tools and setting up the pipeline for your specific environment requires a detailed understanding of your computational environment as well as the overall structure of the [NovaScope](../index.md) pipeline.

In this short tutorial, we will use the [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/docs/) containers
to facilitate the installation and execution of the [NovaScope](../index.md) pipeline with minimal test examples. These examples will give you a basic understanding of the pipeline with minimal effort.

However, to take  full advantage of various features offered by the [NovaScope](../index.md) pipeline, such as systematic parallelization in HPC environment with SLURM, we strongly recommend that you install the pipeline in your computing environment rather than relying solely on the pre-built Docker image. 
Please refer to the [Installation Guide](../installation/requirement.md) for detailed instructions on how to install the pipeline in your computing environment. The [Basic Usage](../basic_usage/intro.md) and [Full Documentation](../fulldoc/intro.md) sections provide more detailed instructions on how to run the pipeline with your own data and 
computing environment.
