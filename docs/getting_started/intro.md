# Getting Started with NovaScope

## Introduction 

This tutorial provides an instruction of running 
[NovaScope](../index.md) based on the 
[three example datasets](https://github.com/seqscope/NovaScope/tree/main/testrun) 
provided with the published protocol. 

Before downloading the example datasets, you must [install](../installation/requirement.md) NovaScope in your computing environment, and 
set up [your own config file](../installation/env_setup.md). 

In this tutorial, we will provide guidance on (a) how to access the 
example datasets, (b) how to set up your input configuration file, and (c)
how to execute the [NovaScope](../index.md) pipeline based on the prepared input files.
