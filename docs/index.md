# Welcome to NovaScope documentation

## Introduction
NovaScope is a [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)-based pipeline that processes spatial transcriptomics data generated from the [Seq-Scope](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.05.010). Currently, it is  specifically tailored for spatial arrays generated from the Illumina [NovaSeq 6000](https://www.illumina.com/systems/sequencing-platforms/novaseq.html) platform. 

### Functionality

The **main purpose** of NovaScope is to process the Seq-Scope sequencing data from scratch to a spatial digital gene expression (SGE) matrix  compatible with variaous single cell and spatial analysis methods.

Additionaly, it provides **plus functionalities**, including histology alignment with SGE matrix, SGE filtering, SGE segment, and SGE reformatting. See more details about the main and plus functionalities in the [WorkFlow Structure](./home/workflow_structure.md).

### Characteristics
NovaScope features a modular and adaptable design, allowing users to tailor the pipeline according to their particular requirements. The use of Snakemake ensures streamlined workflow management, reproducibility, and scalability.

Additionally, NovaScope is designed to operate on Unix-based high-performance computing (HPC) platforms. It provides flexibility in deployment, allowing execution directly on local systems or through the [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html) workload manager.

### An Overview
NovaScope primarily consists of two steps as shown in the figure below.

**Figure 1: Overview of the NovaScope pipeline:** Step 1 processes the 1st-seq FASTQ files to generate spatial barcode maps for each "Chip", a 10x6 array of tiles. Step 2 processes the 2nd-seq FASTQ files, aligns reads to the reference genome, and produces spatial gene expression at submicron resolution.
