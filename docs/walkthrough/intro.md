This Walkthrough section serves as a comprehensive overview of [NovaScope](https://seqscope.github.io/NovaScope/)'s functionality, featuring both a [rule execution guide](./execution_guide/core_concepts.md) and [specific rule instructions](./rules/fastq2sbcd.md).

The [rule execution guide](./execution_guide/core_concepts.md) outlines essential concepts for operating [NovaScope](https://seqscope.github.io/NovaScope/) and offers a glimpse of the execution flows for various `request` options.

Meanwhile, the [specific rule instructions](./rules/fastq2sbcd.md) provide detailed information for each rule, including its purpose, inputs and outputs, tips for reviewing output, parameters, dependencies, and relevant code snippets. The output completes with descriptions, naming conventions, file formats, and visualisation for images.
